# CWT
Calculating coefficients of 2D continuous wavelet transform (CWT) of Morlet and Marr wavelet. This implementation focuses on speeding up the computation time for CPU and GPU. For CPU it employes OpenMP, MPI interface. To speed up in GPU, CUDA API are used.

This project was undertaken during an internship at C-DAC (Centre for Development of Advanced Computing, Govt. Of India), India's pioneering supercomputing facility, located in Pune.
